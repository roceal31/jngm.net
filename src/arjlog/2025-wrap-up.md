Something I rarely do is log or review things, but I'm giving this a go, partly inspired by reflecting in my previous post on how many times I managed to post in 2025, and partly by our plan for our first episode of season 3 of [the podcast](https://momentsofmadness.au).

## Big Life Events

This section is all the major noteworthy things that cropped up for me this year.

  * New job! I embarked on a new career shift to the NSW public service. It has been... okay.
  * Parenting! My kids completed their final year of primary school and kicked off their final year of being pre-teens.
  * Hawaii! My dad had his 80th birthday in November 2024 and we all celebrated in Hawaii, the approximate halfway point between where I live and where he lives.
  * Gigs! I went to see Jinjer (supported by Kittie) at Hordern Pavillion and kicked off a long-running obsession with Kittie's latest album.
  * Fitness! I successfully kicked off three good fitness habits: a weekly swim, regular bike commute to work, and a quick 7-minute workout three times a week.
  * Pet sadness. We lost our dear little rat Addy to misadventure. Hard to believe such a tiny little creature can have such a big impact. But we also adopted two new rats to accompany the surviving rat and they are all keeping things lively.
  * Life admin: for the first time in over a decade I can actually put my clothes into a closet. Taxes, wills & estate plan, and life insurance got sorted. We had to replace the hot water heater.
  * Podcasting! I started a dumb hobby with a smart awesome friend and we're having lots of fun.
  * Social media! I [made a post](https://aus.social/@Roceal/114413693800073125) that got more than two likes.

## Books Read

This isn't an exhaustive list because I'm terrible at keeping track of what I've read. I'm considering using [BookWyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/) in the future if I can get my shit together. This was the list according to a collation of my Apple Books "Finished" list and some additional odds and ends like comic books.

  * The Navigator's Children - Tad Williams
  * The You You Are - Dr Ricken Lazlo Hale, PhD (I couldn't resist. Yes, I am a fan of Severence.)
  * Cataveiro - E. J. Swift
  * Tamaruq - E. J. Swift
  * The Others (series) - Anne Bishop 
  * Echo of Worlds - M. R. Carey
  * Murderbot (series) - Martha Wells
  * The Grimoire Grammar School Parent Teacher Association - Caitlin Rozakis
  * Or What You Will - Jo Walton
  * A Sorceress Comes to Call - T. Kingfisher
  * Brigands & Breadknives - Travis Baldree
  * The Prize in the Game - Jo Walton
  * The Cerulean Chronicles (series) - TJ Klune
  * Elantris - Brandon Sanderson
  * Warbreaker - Brandon Sanderson
  * Broken Earth Trilogy - N. K. Jemisin
  * The Unicorn Project - Gene Kim
  * Livesuit - James SA Corey

Graphic Novel Series - just what I can vaguely remember off the top of my head, and I have no ideas what volumes have been finished when.

  * Saga
  * Paper Girls
  * Rat Queens
  * Delicious in Dungeon

## Wrap Up

I'm not sure what else I'd want to track. Maybe movies / tv shows. I did sign up for Letterboxd at some stage not that long ago and got frustrated with trying to remember / backfill what I had already seen. The only film I can remember seeing last year was the Minecraft Movie in the cinema. That's right, I have no shame.
