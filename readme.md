# Because I Only Work on This Every Six Months #

FFS now I'm abandoning this and trying to set up a basic blog with [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

Will I ever get it together and just get something going again? Only the Flying Spaghetti  Monster knows.

For now this is going to clean out everything I did before and will just follow the Astro Build a Blog tutorial.

Maybe in six years I will write a fucking  blog post, only time will tell.
