# Because I Only Work on This Every Six Months #

FFS now I'm abandoning this and trying to set up a basic blog with [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

Will I ever get it together and just get something going again? Only the Flying Spaghetti  Monster knows.

For now this is going to clean out everything I did before and will just follow the Astro Build a Blog tutorial.

Maybe in six years I will write a fucking  blog post, only time will tell.

## What have I done now?

So far I have ensured the following dependencies:

  * NodeJS is up to date (currently v23.7.0 in my dev environment)
  * Yarn is installed (currently 1.22.22)

And I have run the `create astro` command:

```yarn create astro --template minimal```

To host the site in dev mode  use:

```yarn run dev```

To build the site use:

```yarn run build```
