# It's a Blog, Of Sorts #

The current actual live source for my weblog, using [Astro 5.5](https://astro.build/blog/astro-550/). Now finally, unbelievably live, after a few false starts in the past 6 years.
## What have I done now?

So far I have ensured the following dependencies:

  * NodeJS is up to date (currently v23.7.0 in my dev environment)
  * Yarn is installed (currently 1.22.22)

Steps so far:

  * I have run the `create astro` command:

    ```yarn create astro --template minimal```

  * I have completed the [Astro tutorial]()

  * I have created some minimal layouts, components, pages and posts of my own design

To host the site in dev mode  use:

```yarn run dev```

To build the site use:

```yarn run build```
