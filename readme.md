# Because I Only Work on This Every Six Months #

I'm trying to rewrite my website using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/). Site components thus far:

 * [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
 * Templates are in straight up HTML 5

## To Do The Thing ##

See it in action with:

```npx @11ty/eleventy --serve```

Site should then be accessible on http://localhost:8080
